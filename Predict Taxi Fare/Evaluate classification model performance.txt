/*

After evaluating your model you get a RMSE of 9.47. Since we took the Root of the Mean Squared Error (RMSE) the 9.47 error can be evaluated in the same units as the total_fare so it's +-$9.47.

Knowing whether or not this loss metric is acceptable to productionalize your model is entirely dependent on your benchmark criteria, which is set before model training begins. Benchmarking is establishing a minimum level of model performance and accuracy that is acceptable.
