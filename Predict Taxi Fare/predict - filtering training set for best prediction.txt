As you can see, there are some strange outliers in our dataset (negative fares or fares over $50,000). Let's apply some of our subject matter expertise to help the model avoid learning on strange outliers.

Let's limit the data to only fares between $$6 and $$200. Copy and paste the following into the Query editor and click Run:

SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
# 843,834,902 fares

You should receive a similar output:

That's a little bit better. While you're at, let's limit the distance traveled so you're really focusing on New York City.

Copy and paste the following into the Query editor and click Run:

SELECT
  COUNT(fare_amount) AS num_fares,
  MIN(fare_amount) AS low_fare,
  MAX(fare_amount) AS high_fare,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
FROM
`nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    # 827,365,869 fares

You should receive a similar output:

You still have a large training dataset of over 800 million rides for our new model to learn from. Let's re-train the model with these new constraints and see how well it performs.
