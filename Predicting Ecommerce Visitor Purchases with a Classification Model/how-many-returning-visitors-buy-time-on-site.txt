/*
  time_on_site is the input
  will_buy_on_return_visit is the prediction

  Question: Which two fields are known after a visitor's first session?

  Answer: bounces and time_on_site are known after a visitor's first session.

  Question: Which field isn't known until later in the future?

  Answer: will_buy_on_return_visit is not known after the first visit. Again, you're predicting for a subset of users who returned to your website and purchased. Since you don't know the future at prediction time, you cannot say with certainty whether a new visitor come back and purchase. The value of building a ML model is to get the probability of future purchase based on the data gleaned about their first session.

  Question: Looking at the initial data results, do you think time_on_site and bounces will be a good indicator of whether the user will return and purchase or not?

  Answer: It's often too early to tell before training and evaluating the model, but at first glance out of the top 10 time_on_site only 1 customer returned to buy which isn't very promising. Let's see how well the model does.
