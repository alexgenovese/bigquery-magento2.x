/*

There are many more features in the dataset that may help the model better understand the relationship between a visitor's first session and the likelihood that they will purchase on a subsequent visit.

How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit
Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc..)
Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Geographic information (country)

Note that we are still training on the same first 9 months of data even with this new model. It's important to have the same training dataset so we can be certain a better model output is attributable to better input features and not new or different training data.

A key new feature that has been added is the maximum checkout progress each visitor reached in their session which is recorded in the field hits.eCommerceAction.action_type. If you search for that field in the field definitions you will see the field mapping of 6 = Completed Purchase.

As an aside, the web analytics dataset has nested and repeated fields like ARRAYS which we need to break apart into separate rows in our dataset. This is accomplished by using the UNNEST() function as you see in the above query.

Wait for the new model to finish training (5-10 minutes).
