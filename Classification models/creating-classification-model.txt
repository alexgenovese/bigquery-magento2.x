/*

	Creating a new dataset called ecommerce and getting data from ecommerce public dataset,
	we're going to create a classification model store in Big Query.

	Note that we cannot feed all of our available data to the model during training since we need to save some unseen data points for model evaluation and testing. To accomplish this, we simply add a WHERE clause condition to filter and train on only the first 9 months of session data in our 12 month dataset.
	Next, click Run Query to train your model. 

	Wait for the model to train (5 - 10 minutes).
